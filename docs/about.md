# About

## Motivation

Most Minecraft speedrun guides tell you what to do without showing the math. This guide exists to fill that gap — every strategy claim is backed by data and calculations you can verify.

Inspired by [Couriway's Ultimate Minecraft Speedrun Guide](https://metafy.gg/guides/view/ultimate-minecraft-speedrun-guide-cIzfjeTmwOm/chapter-0-prologue-to-the-guide-DDBFxrFKVrF) and the broader speedrunning community's collective knowledge.

## Methodology

Time calculations in this guide follow these standards:

1. **Mining speeds** are sourced from the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Breaking)
2. **Crafting times** are estimated from in-game testing at 60 FPS
3. **Probability calculations** use the game's documented loot tables
4. **All claims are falsifiable** — if you find an error, submit an issue or PR
