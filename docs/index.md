# Minecraft Speedrun Guide

A data-driven guide to Minecraft speedrunning with validated math, tested strategies, and quantified decision-making.

## Why This Guide

Most speedrun guides tell you *what* to do. This guide tells you *why* — backed by actual numbers.

Every strategy recommendation includes the math behind it, so you can verify the claims yourself and adapt decisions to your specific situation. When the community says "it's not worth crafting X," we check the numbers.

## What Makes This Different

- **Math-backed decisions** — Every time-save claim includes the calculation and methodology
- **Data tables** — Block mining speeds, drop rates, and probability distributions you can reference
- **Open source** — Spot an error? Disagree with the math? [Submit a PR](https://github.com/SullivanXiong/minecraft-speedrun-guide)
- **Version-tracked** — See how strategies evolve as the meta changes

## Quick Start
