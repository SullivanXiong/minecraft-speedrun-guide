## Ocean Navigation

### Using Entity Hitboxes to Spot Ravines

!!! tip "Buried Treasure / Shipwreck Seeds"
    On seeds where you need to cross ocean (buried treasure or shipwreck routes), toggle entity hitboxes with ++f3+b++. Kelp renders its hitbox outline through water at long range, making it visible from the ocean surface. Kelp clusters often line the edges of underwater ravines — so spotting kelp outlines from your boat lets you snipe ravines from a distance without having to scan below the surface.
